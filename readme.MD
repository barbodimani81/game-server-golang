# Multiplayer Map-Based Chat System (GoLang)

This project implements a concurrent multiplayer system in Go where players can:
- Connect to the game
- Move between maps (zones)
- Send and receive messages within their current map

Each player has their own message channel, and all maps support concurrent communication through goroutines and mutexes.

## ðŸ›  Features

- âœ… Connect a player (case-insensitive names, e.g., `john` â†’ `John`)
- âœ… Add players to maps dynamically
- âœ… Switch between maps safely
- âœ… Message broadcasting (within the same map)
- âœ… Fully concurrent using goroutines, mutexes, and channels
- âœ… Thread-safe for multi-client support
